      <h2>Description of Football</h2>
      <p>Football, or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each, aiming to score goals by getting the ball into the opposing team's net.
        It is the world's most popular sport, with a massive global fanbase and major competitions such as the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League, and domestic leagues like the English Premier League.
        The game involves a combination of skill, teamwork, and strategy, with players using their feet to control and pass the ball, and goalkeepers working to prevent goals.
        Matches are played on rectangular fields, and the sport has a rich history, evolving from its roots in England to become a cultural phenomenon across continents.
        Football transcends linguistic and cultural barriers, fostering a sense of unity and shared passion among people worldwide.</p>
